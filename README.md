# IFeel
"Dead Internet" is coming, where are our real experiences and genuine feelings? Here: 

a website: we can share and build a world of "Living internet"

1. send a message: real experiences (I think this is what AI not have), feelings

2. every message: <= 30 words (we can write by ourselves easier), and a question in it (*)
